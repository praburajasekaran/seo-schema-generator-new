Basecamp’s Shape Up defines four core principles of shaping the work before teams build: set boundaries (using an appetite and a clear problem), rough out the key elements at a conceptual level, identify risks and rabbit holes, and write a concise pitch that leadership can bet on.[1][3]

### Set boundaries
- Decide the appetite first (how much time the idea is worth) and frame the problem so scope fits the fixed timebox, instead of estimating a predefined solution.[9][1]
- Shape Up typically uses a six‑week cycle as the fixed boundary, reinforcing “fixed time, variable scope” for meaningful, shippable outcomes.[3][8]

### Rough out elements
- Define the essential parts of the solution at the right level of abstraction so the concept is clear without over‑specifying designs or tasks.[1][3]
- Focus on the main user flows and key states that must exist for the solution to hold together, leaving implementation details for the building phase.[3][1]

### Risks and rabbit holes
- Call out unknowns, tricky UI or technical areas, and potential time sinks during shaping so they can be constrained or avoided before the bet is placed.[2][3]
- Make “no‑gos” explicit where necessary to prevent the team from wandering into work that could blow the appetite or timeline.[1][3]

### Write the pitch
- Capture a tight pitch that includes the problem, the appetite (time budget), the core solution approach, key risks/rabbit holes, and any boundaries or no‑gos.[5][3]
- Pitches go to a betting decision, where leadership selects which shaped work to fund for a cycle, replacing backlogs and sprint commitments with deliberate bets.[5][3]

### Quick example
- For improving onboarding, set an appetite of one six‑week cycle and frame the problem as “cut time‑to-first-success by 50%,” explicitly excluding reporting or billing changes.[8][3]
- Rough out the elements: a guided checklist, inline sample data, and a contextual nudge on first use; avoid pixel‑perfect designs or task lists at this stage.[3][1]
- Flag risks like OAuth edge cases and import performance; declare “no third‑party SSO expansion this cycle” as a no‑go.[2][3]
- Write the pitch with problem, appetite, concept, risks, and no‑gos so it’s ready for a bet in the upcoming cycle.[5][3]
