Certainly! Here are **Dan Mall-inspired design heuristics** you can use as design prompts or constraints within Cursor or other design tools to help your team “think like Dan Mall.” These are actionable guidelines distilled from his signature UI/UX strategies:

### Dan Mall UI/UX Heuristics for Cursor

1. **Start Modular, Not Page-Based**  
   Always begin with "building blocks"—design and code atomic components (buttons, cards, inputs) before tackling full pages. Avoid designing in page silos.

2. **Element Collage Approach**  
   Explore the brand through visual collages: try multiple color palettes, shapes, typographic pairings, and motifs in loosely structured snippets. Prioritize rapid exploration and early feedback over polished comps.

3. **Design for Systems, Not One-Offs**  
   Ask: “Can this be reused?” Document components with clear intent, use cases, and constraints. Optimize for consistency and scalability across projects, not just visual appeal.

4. **Prototype in the Product**  
   Implement design patterns on real, live interfaces—never just in design tools. Validate with code, pilot with real users, and iterate collaboratively.

5. **Continuous Collaboration, Not Handoffs**  
   Replace one-way handoffs with frequent, iterative designer–developer “hot potato” feedback loops. Share unfinished work early and often; keep both sides engaged throughout.

6. **Emphasize 80/20 Craft Investment**  
   Delegate the generic 80% (standard UI) to the system. Focus creative and development energy on the 20% that expresses brand personality and delivers unique user value.

7. **System as Product**  
   Treat your design system like a living product: version it, backlog improvements, and assign owners. Encourage contributions and use organization-wide.

8. **Leave Room for Creativity**  
   Allow opt-outs from the system when justified for business or brand needs. Guide experimentation within guardrails, not arbitrary restrictions.

9. **Design for Evolution**  
   Document “why” behind design choices and regularly revisit them for improvement. Prototype with future extensibility in mind, anticipating where systems may need to flex.

10. **Champion Cross-Disciplinary Input**  
    Invite feedback from engineers, PMs, and stakeholders early and often. Treat the design process as a dialogue, not a presentation.
